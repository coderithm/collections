# Sets

A set is a collection of distinct elements, i.e. a collection that contains no duplicate elements. Sets contain no pair of elements `element1` and `element2` such that `element1 === element2`.


## Basic Operations

There are many operations that can be used when working with sets. The most fundamental operations are:
* Unions
* Intersections
* Complements


#### Unions
Unions are made by the addition of two or more sets together. The *union* of `SetA` and `SetB` is the set of all elements that are members of either `SetA` or `SetB`.

#### Intersections
The intersection of two sets `SetA` and `SetB` is the set of all elements that are members of both `SetA` and `SetB`.

#### Complements
The complement of two sets `SetA` and `SetB` can also be called the difference of `SetA` and `SetB`. The complement of `SetB` in `SetA` is the set of all elements that are members of `SetA` but not members of `SetB`.
