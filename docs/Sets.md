# Sets

A set is a collection of distinct elements, i.e. a collection that contains no duplicate elements. Sets contain no pair of elements `element1` and `element2` such that `element1 === element2`.


## Basic Operations

There are many operations that can be used when working with sets. The most fundamental operations are:
* Unions
* Intersections
* Complements


### Unions
Unions are made by the addition of two or more sets together. The *union* of `SetA` and `SetB` is the set of all elements that are members of either `SetA` or `SetB`.
